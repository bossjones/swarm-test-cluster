# Enhancements

Test cluster provisioning will be largely manual for the first few attempts and will use default settings in Docker Machine and Swarm.
I'll be keeping a note of areas which can be enhanced.  As well as seamlessly scaling the test cluster must be fast to provision.

## Use a pre-build AMI

Using the default AMI provided by Docker Machine caused the initial node startup to take several minutes.  The setup process looks like :

```
Running pre-create checks...
Creating machine...
(node2) Launching instance...
Waiting for machine to be running, this may take a few minutes...
Detecting operating system of created instance...
Waiting for SSH to be available...
Detecting the provisioner...
Provisioning with ubuntu(systemd)...
Installing Docker...
Copying certs to the local machine directory...
Copying certs to the remote machine...
Setting Docker configuration on the remote daemon...
Configuring swarm...
Checking connection to Docker...
Docker is up and running!
```

Suggestion :  Pre-build a node AMI using Packer (https://www.packer.io/)

Using Ansible, Salt or good old bash install Docker, pull the latest Docker Swarm image and install any other default tools that your tests may need.
